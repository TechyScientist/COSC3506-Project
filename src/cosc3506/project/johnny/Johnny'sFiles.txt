The files in this package were written by Johnny C.

I made the following files:
  LoginScreen.java - the login screen
  MainScreen.java - the home screen for logged in users
  Directory.java - a user directory
  UserAdd.java - administrators can add users here
  UserDel.java - administrators can delete users they have added
  UserMod.java - administrators can promote or demote users they have added
  AdminPasswordReset.java - administrators can reset the passwords of users they have added
